# Vulnerability_Checker
Vulnerability_Checker is a python project based on Scrapy Framework which scans your machine to retrieve installed packages or programms and then searches in open source databases to scan if there are vulnerabilities about them. It also creates a typical .log as well as .pdf file with the findings. It serves both linux and windows machines.
